Stable Matching for Energy-Minimized Task Offloading in Cloud-Fog Networks

Problem Statement
------------------------------------------------
Processing massive data consumes lot of energy in cloud fog networks; hence it is
essential to minimize the total energy consumption of a cloud fog-network as
battery life of fog nodes is limited. For minimization of energy in cloud fog
networks, we have to take different combinations of helpers and task nodes into
consideration, which involves combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial
optimization is an NP hard problem but it reduces to polynomial time due to
SMETO.
Hence, the problem statement is to minimize the total energy consumption of
cloud-fog network and the assignment of subtasks from task node (TN) to suitable
fog nodes (FN) so that there is a reduction in computation complexity of network
and we are able to find a stable solution for many to one matching.
